# WLFF documentation

Documentation, todos, leads to follow


## Non-coder TODOs

- [ ] Run `binwalk` on all of the WL insurance files
    - Get binwalk here: <https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/>
- [ ] Search for interesting transaction chains
    - Use our [local-blockchain-parser](https://github.com/WikiLeaksFreedomForce/local-blockchain-parser)'s `tx-chain` command.  The command will find chains, run an analysis on all of the transactions in a given chain, and output a folder containing the results and the list of transactions.  Add that folder to this repo when you find an interesting chain.
